-Title or name of research/training

    Research on a pre trained ML model 

-Why you are doing it.

 To generate outfits.

-What you expect to learn/do.   Be specific by identifying what code/modules will be affected by the research/training.

 Identifying which pre-trained models are most suitable for the task ,Learning how to preprocess and structure fashion data to be compatible with the chosen model, Understanding the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained model to improve its accuracy on the specific dataset,Exploring methods to extract relevant features (e.g., style, occasion) from clothing items.

Learning how to integrate the fine-tuned model into a larger application, potentially involving backend services for model inference and frontend components for user interaction.

-What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  Be specific.  For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient.   "Writing the Login class" is.

Writing a Python script to load the pre-trained model, perform any necessary modifications, and fine-tune it on the fashion dataset.

Crafting algorithms that utilize the extracted features and learned representations to generate compatible outfit combinations

-What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.
