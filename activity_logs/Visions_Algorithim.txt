In a fashion akin to the code snippet provided on the website, 
I will be utilizing a similar approach for interacting with the 
OpenAI API. By initializing a client instance and making use of 
the `chat.completions.create` method, I'll engage the GPT-4 Vision
 Preview model to process image-related queries. Constructing the 
 request involves specifying the model to use, crafting the user 
 message along with associated image data, and setting parameters 
 such as maximum tokens for the completion. Upon execution, the API 
 returns a response containing potential completions, from which the
most relevant choice is extracted and printed. However, my task goes
beyond mere image recognition; I aim to tailor the prompt further, 
delving into our database to extract specific details like the type 
of clothing item depicted, its color, the prevailing weather conditions,
and other pertinent attributes. This nuanced approach enhances the 
accuracy and relevance of the AI's responses, making interactions more
informative and insightful.
